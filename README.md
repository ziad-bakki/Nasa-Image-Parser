# NASA Image Gallery Parser

This project contains a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape NASA's Image of the Day gallery. It navigates through the gallery, collecting URLs of images on each page.
The use will be able to input a keyword, and the program will return all the URLs that have that keyword.
